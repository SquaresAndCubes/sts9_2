STS9 Setlist Project

Hello,

Welcome to the STS9 setlist web project.  The purpose of this project is to build a central setlists database
for Sound Tribe Sector 9.  I have found there is not really a good comprehensive site. My goal is to archive 
as much data as possible and have many statistics available to users.  Right now the database contains ~1350 shows.

A litte background and information about the project.

Inception:

I came up with the Idea in 2016. I began learning Python and web scraping tools.  I created several differnt tools 
to scrape data from various sources of data for the project.  If you are interested in the details of this contact me.
At this point the data is all imported into the database so it is not really relevant anymore.

Most of the DATA is from Setlists.fm,  this has been a great resource.

Current Tech

The Stack:

PostgreSQL,
Django 2.0.6,
Jinja2,
HTML,
Bootstrap/CSS,

Goals:

  Build Comprehensive Statistic Analysis:
      Dates,
      Venues,
      Songs,
      City,
      State,
      Countr,y
      Song Butsout Potentials,
      Average and Current Performance Gaps,
      Etc.
      
  User Accounts:
    Ability to keep track of shows attended and the statistics related.
        Examples:
          Show Count
          # of times each song has been seen
          Think All Things Umphrey's but for STS9

    Select Trusted users will have access to add/modify databases.

Setlist Prediction:
  I was thinking to do this just for Fun.  If it ends up being too accurate I was thinking of not doing it haha:)
  because it would kinda be shitty to know what you are going to see.  But I figure it would be very interesting nonetheless.
  
  Use AI / Machine Learning Engine such as TensorFlow to predict setlists.
